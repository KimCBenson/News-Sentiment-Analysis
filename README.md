# News-Sentiment-Analysis (CSI-280-51 Project)
## By Kimberly Benson, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Griffin Gooch-Breault, Yin Bo Chen

# What Is This Project?

The goal of this project is to allow for a user to feed a pre-trained AI a news headline to pick out key words and sentinment (positive, neutral, negative) within it. By doing this, users can understand how a news headline skews in terms of sentiment, and compare headlines on the same subject to other news outlets.
